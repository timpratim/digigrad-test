"""Gradbot-backed outbound caller — substitute for the LiveKit SIP path.

    [/twilio/stream bridge calls gradbot.run() and shuttles audio]

The gradbot session is configured with the same business prompt + tools
as the LiveKit path (`build_business_prompt`, save_business_result, …).

Audio is tee'd to mixed.wav under
~/.openclaw/workspace/call-recordings/<room>/ so the dashboard
auto-discovers the call exactly like LiveKit calls. A `framework.txt`
marker is written so the dashboard tags it as "gradbot" instead of the
default "livekit".

Public URL plumbing: this module needs the Mac to be reachable from
Twilio. Set `PUBLIC_HTTP_URL=https://<your-tunnel>` and
`PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://<your-tunnel>` in env. Cloudflare tunnel,
ngrok, or any equivalent works.

Run the bridge with:
    uvicorn gradphone.bridge:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8082

# - /dial: callable by us (and eventually the gizmogrid portal). Requires
#   a long random bearer token in `BRIDGE_API_KEY` env. If the env var is
#   unset, requests are allowed but a startup warning is logged — useful
#   for local dev where the bridge is only reachable via 127.0.0.1.
#
# - /twilio/voice + /twilio/stream: callable by Twilio. Verified via
#   Twilio's HMAC-SHA1 signature on `X-Twilio-Signature` using the
#   account auth token. If `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset, validation is
#   skipped with a startup warning.
#
# - /healthz: open. Exposes only "is gradbot installed" + a count.

# Explicit, opt-in escape hatch for purely-local development without the real
# secrets. It must be set deliberately; the mere ABSENCE of a secret never
# disables auth (that would make every misconfigured fork wide open). When this
# is off (the default), missing secrets fail CLOSED.
