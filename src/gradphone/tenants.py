"""Owner profile + call history, backed by the dual SQLite/Postgres layer in db.py.

This deployment serves a single **owner** — the person who registered via the
Telegram bot. Their row in ``tenants`` holds their cloned voice, phone (for
inbound caller-ID routing), and links their call history in the ``calls``
table. ``tenant_id`` is the owner's id, threaded through the call path so the
right voice/memory/history is used.

(The schema keeps the ``tenants``/``tenant_id`` naming, but there is no
multi-tenant enrollment: one deployment, one owner.)

Persistence is SQLite by default (``GRADPHONE_DB``) or Postgres when
``DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql`` / ``DATABASE_URL`` is set — see db.py. All access
is async via SQLAlchemy. The SQL here is portable across both dialects.
