# gradphone — single-container deploy (one Render Web Service).

# Bundles BOTH processes that make up one person's clone:
#   • the bridge  — Twilio webhooks + the Media-Stream WebSocket (binds $PORT)
#   • the bot     — Telegram onboarding / voice-note + text chat
# They share one SQLite DB + recordings on a mounted disk (see render.yaml:
# HOME=/data). ffmpeg is required by the voice-note transcode path and is NOT
# present in Render's native Python env, which is why this is a Docker deploy.
